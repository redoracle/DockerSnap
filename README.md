# DockerSnap
This Bash script automates the creation of a docker-compose file (docker-compose-captured.yml) that mimics the configuration of all currently running Docker containers on the host. It's a way to capture the state of Docker containers and replicate them elsewhere or rebuild the system as it currently exists.
